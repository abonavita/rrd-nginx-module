This is a nginx module that aims at providing a simple REST-like interface
to a RRD database.

First, you configure a nginx location to a database.
  location = /rrd/taratata {
    rrd /var/rrd/taratata.rrd;
  }

Then, you push values there with POST. Something like:
  curl --data-urlencode value=N:123456 http://localhost:8000/rrd/taratata
which should give you the following response if everything went well:
  Updated /var/rrd/taratata.rrd. You make the rock-n-roll go round, Robin.

And if you point your pointer at the location (i.e. you perform a GET), the
module will send you a PNG graph of your RRD.

Enjoy.
